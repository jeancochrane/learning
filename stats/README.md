# Statistics

Learning statistics and data analysis, the Python way.

Generally follows the path of *[Think Stats: Exploratory Data Analysis in Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/index.html)*. Many thanks to Allen Downey for this excellent open-source textbook.

Downey provides a convenient `thinkstats` package for performing a lot of the analysis in the book. Since the first half of this book is review for me, however, my challenge to myself is to re-implement his work on my own. As such, each chapter will have a section for `reading`, where I recreate the work in the chapter, and `exercises`, where I do the exercises.
