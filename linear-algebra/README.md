# Linear Algebra Refresher

This repo catalogues my progress of refreshing linear algebra through code. It follows very closely the syllabus of Udacity's [Linear Algebra Refresher Course.](https://www.udacity.com/course/linear-algebra-refresher-course--ud953)

## Syllabus

### Vectors

- [X] 1. Basic vector operations
- [X] 2. Magnitude and direction
- [X] 3. Dot products
- [X] 4. Parallel and orthogonal vectors
- [X] 5. Projections
- [X] 6. Cross products

### Intersections

*(aka Solving Systems of Linear Equations)*

- [ ] 1. Functions for lines
- [ ] 2. Planes in three dimensions
- [ ] 3. Gaussian elimination
- [ ] 4. More GE
- [ ] 5. Special cases
    - [ ] a. Systems with no solutions
    - [ ] b. Systems with one solution
    - [ ] c. Systems with many solutions
- [ ] 6. Row operations
- [ ] 7. Triangular form
- [ ] 8. RREF
- [ ] 9. GE Solution
- [ ] 10. Parametrization
