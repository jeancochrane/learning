# Exercises for Chapter 2.1

**Exercise 2.1.**

Define a better version of `make-rat` that handles both positive and negative
arguments. `make-rat` should normalize the sign so that if the rational number is
positive, both the numerator and denominator are positive, and if the rational
number is negative, only the numerator is negative. 

**Answer 2.1**

```scheme
(define (make-rat n d)
  ;; Constructor for rational numbers.
  ;; Handles negative numbers, and reduces fractions.
  (let ((g (gcd n d))
        (neg (lambda (x) (- 0 (abs x)))))
    (cond ((or (and (negative? n) (negative? d))
               (and (not (negative? n)) (not (negative? d))))
            (cons (/ (abs n) g) (/ (abs d) g)))
          (else
            (cons (/ (neg n) g) (/ (abs d) g))))))
```
