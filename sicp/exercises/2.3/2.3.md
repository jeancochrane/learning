# Exercises for Chapter 2.3

**Exercise 2.53.**

What would the interpreter print in response to evaluating each of the following expressions?

```scheme
(list 'a 'b 'c)

(list (list 'george))
(cdr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))

(cadr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
(pair? (car '(a short list)))
(memq 'red '((red shoes) (blue socks)))

(memq 'red '(red shoes blue socks))
```

**Answer 2.53.**

```scheme
(list 'a 'b 'c)
>> (a b c)

(list (list 'george))
(cdr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
>> ((george))
>> ((y1 y2))

(cadr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
(pair? (car '(a short list)))
(memq 'red '((red shoes) (blue socks)))
>> (y1 y2)
>> #f
>> #f

(memq 'red '(red shoes blue socks))
>> (red shoes blue socks)
```

**Exercise 2.54.**

Two lists are said to be `equal?` if they contain equal elements arranged in
the same order. For example,

```scheme
(equal? '(this is a list) '(this is a list))
```

is true, but

```scheme
(equal? '(this is a list) '(this (is a) list))
```

is false. To be more precise, we can define `equal?` recursively in terms of the
basic `eq?` equality of symbols by saying that `a` and `b` are `equal?` if they are
both symbols and the symbols are `eq?`, or if they are both lists such that `(car
a)` is `equal?` to `(car b)` and `(cdr a)` is `equal?` to `(cdr b)`. Using this idea,
implement `equal?` as a procedure.

**Exercise 2.55.**

Eva Lu Ator types to the interpreter the expression

```scheme
(car ''abracadabra)
```

To her surprise, the interpreter prints back `quote`. Explain.

**Answer 2.55.**

The behavior here is easier to understand if we substitute the syntactic sugar
`'` for its equivalent special form `quote`. Using `quote`, Eva's expression
is:

```scheme
(car (quote (quote abracadabra)))
```

Notice how the outer `quote` transforms the inner one, changing it from
a literal representation of the string `abracadabra` to a literal
representation of the object `(quote abracadbra)`:

```scheme
(quote abracadabra)
>> abracadabra

(quote (quote abracadabra))
>> (quote abracadabra)
```

Hence, `(car (quote (quote abracadabra)))` will return the first symbol in the
literal `(quote abracadabra)` -- that is, the symbol `quote`!

**Exercise 2.59.**

Implement the `union-set` operation for the unordered-list representation of
sets.

**Answer 2.59.**

```scheme
(define (union-set set1 set2)
  ;;; Find the overlap (union) between two sets
  (if (or (null? set1) (null? set2))
      set2
      (union-set (cdr set1) (adjoin-set (car set1) set2))))
```

**Exercise 2.60.**

We specified that a set would be represented as a list with no duplicates. Now
suppose we allow duplicates. For instance, the set `{1,2,3}` could be represented
as the list `(2 3 2 1 3 2 2)`. Design procedures `element-of-set?`, `adjoin-set`,
`union-set`, and `intersection-set` that operate on this representation. How does
the efficiency of each compare with the corresponding procedure for the
non-duplicate representation? Are there applications for which you would use
this representation in preference to the non-duplicate one?

**Answer 2.60.**

See the comments on each procedure for a comparison of how it performs relative
to the representation with no duplicates:

```scheme
(define (element-of-set? x set)
  ;;; Same as the representation without duplicates
  (cond ((null? set) false)
        ((equal? x (car set)) true)
        (else (element-of-set? x (cdr set)))))

(define (adjoin-set x set)
  ;;; Faster than the representation without duplicates
  (cons x set))

(define (intersection-set set1 set2)
  ;;; Same worst-case performance as the representation without duplicates,
  ;;; but slower on average because the sets can be arbitrarily bigger
  (cond ((or (null? set1) (null? set2)) '())
        ((element-of-set? (car set1) set2)
         (cons (car set1)
               (intersection-set (cdr set1) set2)))
        (else (intersection-set (cdr set1) set2))))

(define (union-set set1 set2)
  ;;; Same procedure as the representation without duplicates, but faster
  ;;; because adjoin-set doesn't have to iterate the whole set
  (if (or (null? set1) (null? set2))
      set2
      (union-set (cdr set1) (adjoin-set (car set1) set2))))
```

In a situation where appending (adjoining and finding the union) is much more
important than finding the intersection, I would use the representation that
includes duplicates, since appends can happen in constant (O(1)) time.

**Exercise 2.61.**

Give an implementation of `adjoin-set` using the ordered representation. By
analogy with `element-of-set?` show how to take advantage of the ordering to
produce a procedure that requires on the average about half as many steps as
with the unordered representation.

```scheme
(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (define (adjoin x prev next)
    (cond ((null? next) (append prev (list x)))
          ((= x (car next)) set)
          ((< x (car next)) (append prev (append (list x) next)))
          (else (adjoin x (append prev (list (car next))) (cdr next)))))
  (adjoin x '() set))
```

Since this implementation of `adjoin-set` can break whenever the element `x`
is shown to be greater than (or equal to) an element in `set`, it exhibits the
same sort of performance as the ordered representation of `element-of-set`: O(n)
in the worst case (when `x` is not in the list and greater than every element
of `set`) but taking half the time on average.
