# Exercises for Section 1.3

**Exercise 1.29.**

Simpson's Rule is a more accurate method of numerical integration than the
method illustrated above. Using Simpson's Rule, the integral of a function
`f` between `a` and `b` is approximated as:

```
(h/3) * (y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + ... + 2y_n-2 + 4y_n-1 + y_n)
```

where `h = (b - a)/n`, for some even integer `n`, and `y_k = f(a + kh)`. (Increasing
`n` increases the accuracy of the approximation.) Define a procedure that takes
as arguments `f`, `a`, `b`, and `n` and returns the value of the integral, computed
using Simpson's Rule. Use your procedure to integrate `cube` between 0 and
1 (with n = 100 and n = 1000), and compare the results to those of the integral
procedure shown above.

**Answer 1.29.** 

Here's a procedure to compute a definite integral using Simpson's Rule:

```scheme
(define (h a b n)
  ;; `h` as defined in Simpson's rule
  (/ (- b a) n))

(define (yk f a b n k)
  ;; The incremental function evaluation in the sum term
  ;; of Simpson's rule
  (f (+ a (* k (h a b n)))))

(define (coef k)
  ;; The coefficient of yk in the sum term of Simpson's rule
  (cond ((= 0 k) 1)
        ((even? k) 4)
        (else 2)))

(define (simpsons-sum f a b n k)
  ;; The sum term of Simpson's rule
  (if (= k n)
      (yk f a b n k)
      (+ (* (coef k) (yk f a b n k))
         (simpsons-sum f a b n (+ k 1)))))

(define (simpsons-rule f a b n)
  ;; Compute the definite integral of `f` between `a` and `b`
  ;; to a resolution of `n`
  (* (/ (h a b n) 3) (simpsons-sum f a b n 0)))
```

And here's the integral of `cube` between 0 and 1 at various resolutions:

```
> (simpsons-rule cube 0 1 100)
0.24671666666666667

> (simpsons-rule cube 0 1 1000)
0.24966716666666666
```

**Exercise 1.30.**

The `sum` procedure above generates a linear recursion. The procedure can be
rewritten so that the sum is performed iteratively. Show how to do this by
filling in the missing expressions in the following definition:

```scheme
(define (sum term a next b)
  (define (iter a result)
    (if <??>
        <??>
        (iter <??> <??>)))
  (iter <??> <??>))
```

**Answer 1.30.**

```scheme
(define (sum term a next b)
  ;; An iterative version of the generic summation procedure.
  (define (iter a result)
    (if (> a b)
        result
        (iter (next a) (+ (term a) result))))
  (iter a 0))
```

**Exercise 1.31.a**

The `sum` procedure is only the simplest of a vast number of similar abstractions
that can be captured as higher-order procedures. Write an analogous procedure
called `product` that returns the product of the values of a function at points
over a given range. Show how to define `factorial` in terms of `product`. Also use
`product` to compute approximations to `pi` using the formula:

```
(pi / 4) = (2 * 4 * 4 * 6 * 6 * 8 ...) / (3 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 7 * 7 ...)
```

**Answer 1.31.a**

Procedure definitions:

```scheme
(define (product term a next b)
  ;; A higher-order procedure to generate product procedures
  (if (> a b)
      1
      (* (term a) (product term (next a) next b))))

(define (factorial n)
  ;; The factorial function defined in terms of `product`
  (define (term n) n)
  (define (next n) (+ n 1))
  (product term 1 next n))

(define (pi-approx n)
  ;; Approximate pi to the resolution `n`
  (define (term x)
    (if (even? x)
        (/ (+ 2 x) (+ 1 x))
        (/ (+ 1 x) (+ 2 x))))
  (define (next x) (+ 1 x))
  (* 4 (product term 1 next n)))
```

Approximations of `pi`:

```
> (pi-approx 10)
3.2751010413348074

> (pi-approx 100)
3.1570301764551676

> (pi-approx 1000)
3.1431607055322663
```

**Exercise 1.31.b**

If your `product` procedure generates a recursive process, write one that
generates an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write one
that generates a recursive process.

**Answer 1.31.b**

```scheme
(define (product-iter term a next b)
  ;; An iterative version of `product`
  (define (iter a result)
    (if (> a b)
        result
        (iter (next a) (* (term a) result))))
  (iter a 1))
```

**Exercise 1.32.a.**

Show that `sum` and `product` (exercise 1.31) are both special cases of a still
more general notion called `accumulate` that combines a collection of terms,
using some general accumulation function:

```
(accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
```

`accumulate` takes as arguments the same term and range specifications as `sum` and
`product`, together with a combiner procedure (of two arguments) that specifies
how the current term is to be combined with the accumulation of the preceding
terms and a null-value that specifies what base value to use when the terms run
out. Write `accumulate` and show how `sum` and `product` can both be defined as
simple calls to `accumulate`.

**Answer 1.32.a.**

```scheme
(define (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
  ;; A higher-order procedure to generate "accumulation" procedures
  ;; (Like `product` and `sum`
  (if (> a b)
      null-value
      (combiner (term a)
                (accumulate combiner null-value term (next a) next b))))
```

Redefining `sum` and `product` using `accumulate` is simple:

```scheme
(define (sum a b)
  (define (combiner a b) (+ a b))
  (define null-value 0)
  (define (term n) n)
  (define (next n) (+ 1 n))
  (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b))

(define (product a b)
  (define (combiner a b) (* a b))
  (define null-value 1)
  (define (term n) n)
  (define (next n) (+ 1 n))
  (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b))
```


**Exercise 1.32.b.**

If your `accumulate` procedure generates a recursive process, write one that
generates an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write one
that generates a recursive process.

**Answer 1.32.b.**

```
(define (accumulate-iter combiner null-value term a next b)
  ;; Iterative version of `accumulate` 
  (define (iter a result)
    (if (> a b)
        result
        (iter (next a) (combiner (term a) result))))
  (iter a null-value))
```

**Exercise 1.33.**

You can obtain an even more general version of `accumulate` (exercise 1.32) by
introducing the notion of a filter on the terms to be combined. That is,
combine only those terms derived from values in the range that satisfy
a specified condition. The resulting `filtered-accumulate` abstraction takes the
same arguments as `accumulate`, together with an additional predicate of one
argument that specifies the filter. Write `filtered-accumulate` as a procedure.

```scheme
(define (filtered-accumulate combiner null-value filter term a next b)
  ;; Higher-order abstraction to generate accumulation procedures
  ;; (Like sum, product, sum-of-squares)
  (cond ((> a b) null-value)
        ((filter a)
         (combiner (term a)
                (filtered-accumulate combiner null-value filter term (next a) next b)))
        (else (filtered-accumulate combiner null-value filter term (next a) next b))))
```

**Exercise 1.33.a.**

Show how to express the sum of the squares of the prime numbers in the interval
`a` to `b` (assuming that you have a `prime?` predicate already written) using
`filtered-accumulate`.

```scheme
(define (sum-of-prime-squares a b)
  ;; Sum the squares of the prime series using `filtered-accumulate`
  (define (filter n) (prime? n))
  (define (combiner a b) (+ a b))
  (define null-value 0)
  (define (term n) (* n n))
  (define (next n) (+ 1 n))
  (filtered-accumulate combiner null-value filter term a next b))
```

**Exercise 1.33.a.**

Show how to express the product of all the positive integers less than `n` that
are relatively prime to `n` (i.e., all positive integers `i < n` such that `GCD(i,n)
= 1`) using `filtered-accumulate`.

```scheme
(define (product-of-primes n)
  ;; Find the product of all positive integers less than `n` that
  ;; are relatively prime to `n` (i.e., all positive integers `i < n`
  ;; such that `GCD(i,n) = 1`)
  (define (relative-prime? a)
    (= (gcd a n) 1))
  (define (filter a) (relative-prime? a))
  (define (combiner a b) (* a b))
  (define null-value 1)
  (define (term a) a)
  (define (next a) (+ 1 a))
  (filtered-accumulate combiner null-value filter term 1 next n))
```
