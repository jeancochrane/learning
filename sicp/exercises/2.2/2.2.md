# Exercises for Chapter 2.2

**Exercise 2.20.**

Use [dotted-tail] notation to write a procedure `same-parity` that takes one or
more integers and returns a list of all the arguments that have the same even-odd
parity as the first argument. For example,

```
(same-parity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
(1 3 5 7)

(same-parity 2 3 4 5 6 7)
(2 4 6)
```

**Answer 2.20.**

```scheme
(define (same-parity a . z)
  (define (parity-list con? res lst)
    (cond ((null? lst) res)
          ((con? (car lst))
            (parity-list con? (append res (list (car lst))) (cdr lst)))
          (else
            (parity-list con? res (cdr lst)))))
  (if (even? a)
      (parity-list even? (list a) z)
      (parity-list odd? (list a) z)))
```

**Exercise 2.21.**

The procedure `for-each` is similar to `map`. It takes as arguments a procedure and
a list of elements. However, rather than forming a list of the results,
`for-each` just applies the procedure to each of the elements in turn, from left
to right. The values returned by applying the procedure to the elements are not
used at all -- `for-each` is used with procedures that perform an action, such as
printing. For example,

```scheme
(for-each (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
          (list 57 321 88))
57
321
88 
```

The value returned by the call to `for-each` (not illustrated above) can be
something arbitrary, such as `true`. Give an implementation of `for-each`.

**Answer 2.21.**

One way to implement `for-each` is to recurse progressively down the list:

```scheme
(define (for-each f lst)
  ;; Apply a function `f` to every item in the list `lst`, returning `true`
  (cond ((null? lst) #t)
        (else
          (f (car lst))
          (for-each f (cdr lst)))))
```

If we don't care at all about the return value, however, using `map` will
also work just fine:

```scheme
(define (for-each-map f lst)
  ;; Apply a function `f` to every item in the list `lst`, returning a list
  ;; of undefined elements with the same length as `lst`
  (map f lst))
```

**Exercise 2.26.**

Suppose we define x and y to be two lists:

```scheme
(define x (list 1 2 3))
(define y (list 4 5 6))
```

What result is printed by the interpreter in response to evaluating each of the
following expressions:

```scheme
(append x y)

(cons x y)

(list x y)
```

**Answer 2.26.**

```scheme
(append x y)
> (1 2 3 4 5 6)

(cons x y)
> ((1 2 3) 4 5 6)

(list x y)
> ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
```

**Exercise 2.28.**

Write a procedure `fringe` that takes as argument a tree (represented as a list)
and returns a list whose elements are all the leaves of the tree arranged in
left-to-right order. For example,

```scheme
(define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))

(fringe x)
(1 2 3 4)

(fringe (list x x))
(1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4)
```

**Answer 2.28.**

```scheme
(define (fringe tree)
  ;;; Return a flattened version of the list `tree` (all the leaves arranged in
  ;;; left-to-right order)
  (define (flatten-tree res lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        res
        (let ((elem (car lst)))
          (if (list? elem)
              (flatten-tree (flatten-tree res elem)
                            (cdr lst))
              (flatten-tree (append res (list elem))
                            (cdr lst))))))
  (flatten-tree (list) tree))
```

**Exercise 2.30.**

Define a procedure `square-tree` analogous to the `square-list` procedure of
exercise 2.21. That is, `square-tree` should behave as follows:

```scheme
(square-tree
 (list 1
       (list 2 (list 3 4) 5)
       (list 6 7)))
(1 (4 (9 16) 25) (36 49))
```

Define `square-tree` both directly (i.e., without using any higher-order
procedures) and also by using `map` and recursion.

**Answer 2.30.**

Here's a direct implementation of `square-tree`:

```scheme
(define (square-tree tree)
  ;;; Direct implementation of list squarer (without using map)
  (cond (null? tree) (list) ; Base case
        (not (pair? tree) (square tree))
        (else (cons (square-tree (car tree))
                    (square-tree (cdr tree))))))
```

And an implementation using `map` and recursion:

```scheme
(define (map-square-tree tree)
  ;;; Implementation of `square-tree` using `map` and recursion
  (map (lambda (sub-tree)
         (if (pair? sub-tree)
            (map-square-tree sub-tree)
            (square sub-tree)))
       tree))
```

**Exercise 2.36.**

The procedure `accumulate-n` is similar to `accumulate` except that it takes as its
third argument a sequence of sequences, which are all assumed to have the same
number of elements. It applies the designated accumulation procedure to combine
all the first elements of the sequences, all the second elements of the
sequences, and so on, and returns a sequence of the results. For instance, if
`s` is a sequence containing four sequences, `((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11
12))`, then the value of `(accumulate-n + 0 s)` should be the sequence `(22 26 30)`.
Fill in the missing expressions in the following definition of `accumulate-n`:

```scheme
(define (accumulate-n op init seqs)
  (if (null? (car seqs))
      nil
      (cons (accumulate op init <??>)
            (accumulate-n op init <??>))))
```

**Answer 2.36.**

```scheme
(define (accumulate-n op init seqs)
  ;;; Apply the operator `op` to a sequence of sequences, `seqs`, such that
  ;;; the elements of each sequence at a given index are accumulated
  (if (null? (car seqs))
      (list)
      (cons (accumulate op init (map car seqs))
            (accumulate-n op init (map cdr seqs)))))
```

**Exercise 2.37.**

Suppose we represent vectors v = (vi) as sequences of numbers, and matrices
m = (mij) as sequences of vectors (the rows of the matrix). For example, the
matrix:

```
| 1 2 3 4 |
| 4 5 6 6 |
| 6 7 8 9 |
```

is represented as the sequence `((1 2 3 4) (4 5 6 6) (6 7 8 9))`. With this
representation, we can use sequence operations to concisely express the basic
matrix and vector operations. These operations (which are described in any book
on matrix algebra) are the following:

```scheme
(dot-product v w)     -> returns sum_i(v_i * w_i)
(matrix-*-vector m v) -> returns vector t, where t_i = sum_j(m_ij * v_j)
(matrix-*-matrix m n) -> returns matrix p, where p_ij = sum_k(m_ik * n_kj)
(transpose m)         -> returns matrix n, where n_ij = m_ji
```

We can define the dot product as

```scheme
(define (dot-product v w)
  (accumulate + 0 (map * v w)))
```

Fill in the missing expressions in the following procedures for computing the
other matrix operations. (The procedure `accumulate-n` is defined in exercise
2.36.)

```scheme
(define (matrix-*-vector m v)
  (map <??> m))
(define (transpose mat)
  (accumulate-n <??> <??> mat))
(define (matrix-*-matrix m n)
  (let ((cols (transpose n)))
    (map <??> m)))
```

**Answer 2.37.**

Functional programming is amazing -- look at how simple these definitions are!

```scheme
(define (matrix-*-vector m v)
  (map (lambda (row) (dot-product row v)) m))

(define (transpose mat)
  (accumulate-n cons (list) mat))

(define (matrix-*-matrix m n)
  (let ((cols (transpose n)))
    (map (lambda (row) (matrix-*-vector cols row)) m)))
```

**Exercise 2.40.**

Define a procedure `unique-pairs` that, given an integer `n`, generates the
sequence of pairs `(i,j)` with `1 < j < i < n`. Use `unique-pairs` to simplify the
definition of `prime-sum-pairs` given above. 

**Answer 2.40.**

```scheme
(define (unique-pairs n)
  ;;; Generate the sequence of pairs (i, j) such that 1 < j < i < n
  (map (lambda (i)
         (map (lambda (j) (list i j))
                (enumerate-integers 1 (- i 1))))
       (enumerate-integers 1 n)))
```
